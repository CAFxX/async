# async

Tiny futures library for Go. ðŸ”®

- Supports eager and lazy evaluation, both synchronous and asynchronous
- Generics-based
- Propagates panics
- Designed to interoperate with [`context`](https://pkg.go.dev/context)

[![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/CAFxX/async)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CAFxX/async)

## Usage

Let's start with a simple example:

```go
f := NewFuture(func() ([]byte, error) {
    res, err := http.Get("http://www.example.com")
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer res.Body.Close()
    return io.ReadAll(res.Body)
})
```

at this point, exeuction of the function wrapped in the `Future` has not
started yet.

There are multiple ways to do it, the simplest being calling `Result`.
If multiple calls to `Result` are done concurrently, only the first
one starts execution of the wrapped function; when the wrapped function
completes the same result is returned to all current (and future) callers
of `Result`:

```go
go func() {
    buf, err := f.Result(ctx1)
    // use buf and err
}()
go func() {
    buf, err := f.Result(ctx2)
    // use buf and err
}()
```

A call to `Result` return immediately if the context is cancelled. This
does not cancel execution of the wrapped function (to cancel execution
of the wrapped function use a context or other cancellation mechanism 
in the wrapped function). So, for example in the code above is `ctx1` is
cancelled the call to `Result` in the first goroutine will return
immediately, but the call in the second goroutine will continue waiting
until the wrapped function returns.

An important feature of the futures provided by this library is that they
propagate panics, so e.g. in the example above if the function wrapped by
the `Future` panicked, the panic would be caught and each call to `Result`
would panic instead (if `Result` is not called and the wrapped function
panics, the panic will be delivered to the go runtime instead, crashing
the process as if the panic had not been recovered).

### A more complex example

The real power of this library lies in its ability to quickly build
lazy evaluation trees that still allow to build complex 

```go
foo := NewFuture(func() (Foo, error) {
    return /* ... */
})
bar := NewFuture(func() (Bar, error) {
    return /* ... */
})
baz := NewFuture(func() (Baz, error) {
    return /* ... */
})

x := NewFuture(func() (string, error) {
    bar.Eager() // start eager evaluation of bar
    res, err := foo.Result(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    res2, err := bar.Result()
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return fmt.Sprintf("%v,%v", res, res2), nil
})
y := NewFuture(func() (string, error) {
    baz.Eager() // start eager evaluation of baz
    res, err := foo.Result(ctx) // note: result will be reused
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    res2, err := baz.Result()
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return fmt.Sprintf("%v,%v", res, res2), nil
})
```

We have now built the evaluation trees. Instead of using futures,
we could have simply started eager evaluation of all these functions,
and this would would work in simple cases.

Now consider though what would happen if you did not always need
all functions to be evaluated, and instead you needed only different
subsets depending on the logic of your application. Executing all
the functions anyway just in case they are needed would be extremely
resource-inefficient, even if you could prune uneeded functions by
selectively cancelling the respective context. Alternatively, you
could execute everything serially, once you are certain that each
function needs to be executed, but this would potentially be very
slow (e.g. in case they involve performing network requests).

Using this library you can instead do:

```go
if req.needX {
    x.Eager()
}
if req.needY {
    y.Eager()
}

res := &Response{}
if req.needX {
    r, err := x.Result(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    res.x = r
}
if req.needY {
    r, err := y.Result(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    res.y = r
}
return res, nil
```

This will concurrently execute all functions required to satisfy
the request, and none of the functions that are not required, while
maximizing readability and separation of concerns.

## Future plans

Some potential ideas:

- Support also promises
- Adapters for common patterns
